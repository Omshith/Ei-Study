smart home
The provided Python code implements a simulation of a Smart Home System using object-oriented programming and design patterns such as the Factory Method and Observer Pattern. The Smart Home Hub manages different devices (Light, Thermostat, DoorLock) and provides functionalities to control them, set schedules, and automate tasks.

The code defines an abstract Device class with a method to get the device status. Concrete classes (Light, Thermostat, DoorLock) inherit from Device and implement their specific behaviors.

The SmartHomeHub class acts as the central hub, allowing users to add/remove devices, turn on devices, set schedules, and add triggers for automation. It uses the Observer Pattern to update devices based on scheduled tasks and triggers.

The main function (main()) creates instances of devices, adds them to the Smart Home Hub, and simulates user commands to turn on devices, set schedules, and add triggers. It then simulates time progression and updates the hub, printing the status report, scheduled tasks, and automated triggers.

To use the code, users can define devices, add them to the hub, and simulate interactions with the Smart Home System.

Title: Smart Home System Simulation

Description:
This Python code simulates a Smart Home System, allowing users to control lights, thermostats, and door locks through a central hub. The system supports setting schedules and automating tasks. The code uses object-oriented principles and design patterns such as the Factory Method and Observer Pattern.

Usage:

Define devices (e.g., lights, thermostats, door locks).
Create a SmartHomeHub instance and add devices to it.
Simulate user commands to turn on devices, set schedules, and add triggers.
Simulate time progression and update the hub.
Print the status report, scheduled tasks, and automated triggers.
